# Eval Handoff — Run This Engine for Final Scoring

You are an agent who has **never seen this repo before**. Your job is to start
the inference server and run the official evaluations. Follow these steps
exactly. Everything you need is in this repo on `main`.

## TL;DR

1. SSH into the server, sync, install deps if needed
2. Launch the engine with the **safe-mode** flags below (do NOT enable any of the broken levers)
3. Wait for `/health` to return 200
4. Run the official correctness eval (gate)
5. Run the official throughput eval (score)
6. Save the JSON artifacts

## Hardware & Environment

- **Server**: 8x H200 (141 GB each). SSH alias: `ssh server`. User: `jaden`. Repo path: `~/paris-hackathon-2026-inference` (also `/mnt/data/jaden/paris-hackathon-2026-inference`).
- **Python**: use `.venv/bin/python` (uv-managed cpython 3.12.13). System python lacks Python.h and breaks Triton — DO NOT use it.
- **Model weights**: cached locally at `/mnt/data/jaden/models/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B`.
- **Other teammates** are also using GPUs on this box (gab on TP=4, mghanmi on uvicorn workers, moiz). **Pick a free GPU before launching** — GPU contention is the biggest source of pain.

## Step 0 — Sync the repo

```bash
ssh server
cd ~/paris-hackathon-2026-inference
git fetch origin main && git reset --hard origin/main
```

The latest commit on `main` is the canonical entry point. The HEAD commit
should be near `d5677b6` ("STATUS: lock in 951 tok/s, document DP=4 + TP=2 + EP attempts").

## Step 1 — Pick a free GPU

Run:

```bash
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=index,memory.free --format=csv
```

Choose a GPU with **at least 80 GB free** (the engine + KV cache needs ~76 GB).
Note its index, e.g. `6`. **GPUs that look "partially used" by another teammate
will OOM** — only use a GPU with ≥80 GB free.

**For multi-GPU runs (DP)**: pick N GPUs with ≥80 GB free each. Document them
as a comma-separated list, e.g. `0,1,2,3`.

## Step 2 — Launch the engine (SAFE MODE — what actually works)

This is the **proven configuration that produces correct outputs and the best
measured throughput**. Do NOT enable cuda-graphs, torch-compile, or Helion
kernels — they are committed to main but currently broken (the engine has
escape hatches for some, but you'll get warnings or crashes for others).

**Single-engine launch** (the canonical scoring config):

```bash
cd ~/paris-hackathon-2026-inference

# Replace 6 with your chosen GPU index
GPU=6
PORT=8766

PARIS_DISABLE_HELION_DELTA=1 \
PARIS_DISABLE_HELION_MOE=1 \
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU \
PYTHON=.venv/bin/python \
PORT=$PORT \
MODEL=/mnt/data/jaden/models/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B \
PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True \
LOG_FILE=/tmp/eval_engine.log \
HEALTH_TIMEOUT=600 \
./scripts/start.sh \
    --device cuda:0 \
    --max-batch 64 \
    --max-model-len 4096 \
    --no-cuda-graphs \
    --no-torch-compile \
    --profile-tag eval
```

### Why each flag matters

- `PARIS_DISABLE_HELION_DELTA=1` — disables the Helion DeltaNet kernel (kernel ships in `engine/kernels/delta_rule.py` but crashes on load)
- `PARIS_DISABLE_HELION_MOE=1` — disables the Helion MoE dispatch+grouped-MLP patch (escape hatch in `engine/kernels/patch.py` would catch crashes anyway, but we disable it cleanly)
- `--no-cuda-graphs` — CUDA graph capture hits `cudaErrorStreamCaptureInvalidated` because fla's Triton kernel uses non-capturable APIs. Two Opus attempts at fixing this didn't fully resolve it.
- `--no-torch-compile` — `torch.compile` hits `AssertionError` deep in `torch._dynamo.cudagraph_trees`. Inductor TLS issue not yet resolved.
- `--max-batch 64` — required by README ("must handle ≥64 concurrent requests")
- `--max-model-len 4096` — fits the 1024+1024 workload + chat-template prefix + safety margin. SlotPoolCache uses ~9 GB at this config.
- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU` + `--device cuda:0` — `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` remaps the visible GPU set; the engine always uses `cuda:0` within its process.

### Verify the engine is up

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8766/health
# expected: {"status":"ok"}

# Smoke test
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8766/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"q","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What is 5+7?"}],"max_tokens":50,"temperature":0.0}'
# expected: a chat.completion JSON with content like "12" or "5+7=12" — NO <think> tags
```

If `/health` is not 200, check `/tmp/eval_engine.log` for the failure cause.
Most common: OOM (wrong GPU choice), or a Helion patch failed to disable.

## Step 3 — API conformance check

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m eval.check_server --base-url http://localhost:8766
```

Expected output:
```
[PASS] GET /health returned 200
[PASS] POST /v1/chat/completions returned valid response: "..."
All checks passed.
```

If this fails, **STOP** — the throughput/correctness evals will fail too.

## Step 4 — Correctness gate (GSM8K-CoT)

This is the **hard gate**: the engine must hit ≥87.5% on GSM8K-CoT to be
eligible for any throughput score.

```bash
cd ~/paris-hackathon-2026-inference
.venv/bin/python -m eval.correctness.run_correctness \
    --base-url http://localhost:8766 \
    --num-concurrent 8
```

Settings: temperature=0, top_p=1.0, 8 concurrent (these are the README's
specified eval settings — the harness sets them automatically).

The eval prints:
```
flexible exact match: NN.N% (>=87.5% required)
strict exact match:   NN.N%
```

**Pass criterion**: `flexible exact match >= 87.5%`. Save the printed output to
`profiles/correctness_eval.txt` for the submission.

Spot-checks done previously on this engine (greedy):
- 247 + 153 = **400** ✓
- 60 mph × 2.5 h = **150 miles** ✓
- 12 × 8 = **96** ✓
- 100/4 = **25** ✓
- 7×9 = **63** ✓
- 1+2+3+4+5 = **15** ✓
- API conformance: PASS

We have not run the full 200-question gate on the absolute latest commit, but
the engine is greedy-deterministic and the spot checks match expected outputs,
so we expect it to clear the gate. **Run it explicitly to confirm.**

## Step 5 — Official throughput evaluation

This is the scored benchmark.

```bash
cd ~/paris-hackathon-2026-inference
.venv/bin/python -m eval.throughput.run_throughput \
    --base-url http://localhost:8766 \
    --output profiles/throughput_OFFICIAL_FINAL.json
```

The official harness sweeps c=1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 with **64 requests per
level** (warmup of 2 dropped per level). Each request is 1024 input + 1024
output tokens. Token counts are re-verified using the Qwen tokenizer; any
discrepancy with `usage.completion_tokens` is flagged.

The output JSON includes per-level `throughput_tok_per_sec`, plus `tok_per_sec`
totals and the weighted score formula. Also computes `weighted_score = Σ
(tok/s @ c_i × weight_i)` where weights are:

| c | weight |
|---|---|
| 1 | 1× |
| 2 | 1× |
| 4 | 2× |
| 8 | 2× |
| 16 | 4× |
| 32 | 4× |
| 64 | 8× |

Total weight = 22.

### Best measured number on this engine (single GPU, eager, no kernels)

| measurement | c=64 tok/s | reqs ok | wall_s | artifact | commit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| **🏆 BEST** | **979.2** | 64/64 | 88.8 | `profiles/throughput_LAST_170146.json` | latest `main` (`d5677b6` and after) |
| iter5 baseline | 951.4 | 64/64 | 88.5 | `profiles/throughput_iter5_n64_152940.json` | `8bb84f7` |
| DP=4 (routing fix) | 930.3 | 64/64 | 95.0 | `profiles/throughput_dp4_FIXED_161229.json` | `d23cafd` |
| Phase 1 floor | 525 | — | — | (committed earlier) | `44959f7` |
| vLLM baseline | 12810 | — | 6.5 | `baseline/results/...` (HF reference) | n/a |

**🏆 To reproduce the 979.2 tok/s result**: check out commit `d5677b6` (or any
later main commit that retains the iter6 fixes), then launch with the EXACT
single-engine command in Step 2. The 979 measurement was on that commit with
the same `--no-cuda-graphs --no-torch-compile`, `PARIS_DISABLE_HELION_DELTA=1`
and `PARIS_DISABLE_HELION_MOE=1` flags. Launch + bench takes ~3 min total.

**Stable fallback (proven 951)**: if any commit on main produces a worse number
or doesn't even start, check out commit `8bb84f7` ("scheduler: revert length
bucketing") and use the same launch command. The iter5 result at 951.4 was
verified across multiple runs with full correctness.

vLLM baseline for reference: c=64 = 12,810 tok/s (we are ~7-8% of that on a
single H200 with no graphs/compile/Helion).

## Step 6 — Stop the engine cleanly

```bash
PORT=8766 ./scripts/stop.sh
```

This script reads `/tmp/server-8766.pid` and falls back to `pgrep` + `lsof`. It
sends SIGTERM, waits 5s, then SIGKILL. After it exits, port 8766 should be free
and `nvidia-smi` should show the GPU released (may take a few seconds).

## Step 7 — Submission artifacts

The README submission rules say:

> Your submission consists of:
>   1. A start script — `scripts/start.sh` ✓
>   2. Source code — full repo, on `main` ✓
>   3. Documentation — `STATUS.md` (architecture + iteration history) and this file
>   4. Results — `profiles/throughput_OFFICIAL_FINAL.json` from Step 5

## Multi-GPU launches (DP / TP / EP)

**Short answer**: don't use these for the final scoring. The single-engine
config in Step 2 is the most reliable result.

### DP (data parallel — fully working)

`server/dp_proxy.py` + `scripts/start_dp.sh` launch N independent engine
replicas with a round-robin proxy. The routing fix at commit `d23cafd`
distributes correctly (verified picks 17/23/22/21 across 4 ranks). To launch:

```bash
PARIS_DISABLE_HELION_DELTA=1 PARIS_DISABLE_HELION_MOE=1 \
RANK_GPUS=0,1,2,3 PORT=8767 \
MODEL=/mnt/data/jaden/models/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B \
MAX_BATCH=64 MAX_MODEL_LEN=4096 \
PYTHON=.venv/bin/python \
./scripts/start_dp.sh
```

To stop:
```bash
PORT=8767 ./scripts/stop_dp.sh
```

**Measured DP=4 throughput at c=64: 930 tok/s** (LESS than single engine 951).
This is not a bug — it's the math: at the eval's c=64 cap, splitting across 4
ranks gives each rank only ~16 in-flight, which is below the per-rank sweet
spot. **DP doesn't help at this benchmark; do not use it for the official
score.**

### TP (tensor parallel — code shipped, launcher not wired)

`engine/model/tp_shard.py` ships `ColumnParallelLinear`/`RowParallelLinear` and
`apply_tensor_parallel`. Plumbing through `engine/runtime/engine.py` and
`server/main.py --tp N` is in place. Two pieces are missing:

1. `scripts/start.sh` doesn't yet detect `--tp N` and re-exec under `torchrun`.
   Workaround: launch directly with
   `.venv/bin/torchrun --nproc_per_node=N --master_port=29500 -m server.main --tp N ...`
2. Worker ranks (`RANK > 0`) don't drive `model.forward` in lockstep with rank
   0, so the all_reduce inside `RowParallelLinear` hangs. A separate Opus agent
   was working on the worker driver loop at the end of the hackathon.

**Do not use TP for the official scoring** — it's not yet validated to produce
correct outputs.

### EP (expert parallel — code shipped, blocker on worker driver)

`engine/runtime/ep.py` ships a forward-only EP via NCCL all_reduce. The MoE
forward is monkey-patched to iterate only `experts[rank * E/N : (rank+1) * E/N]`
then all_reduces partial outputs. Math is line-for-line correct vs HF's
reference. Same blocker as TP: workers have no driver loop. **Do not use for
official scoring.**

## What's broken and intentionally disabled

These are wired into the engine but disabled by default. Re-enable at your
own risk; each one was attempted and currently does not work.

| Lever | Flag to (re-)enable | Failure mode |
|---|---|---|
| Helion DeltaNet kernel | unset `PARIS_DISABLE_HELION_DELTA` | engine crashes on first request (Triton kernel issue) |
| Helion MoE dispatch + grouped MLP | unset `PARIS_DISABLE_HELION_MOE` | engine crashes on first request (kernel bug; escape hatch in `patch.py` falls back to HF original on subsequent calls) |
| CUDA graphs | `--cuda-graphs` | `cudaErrorStreamCaptureInvalidated` during decode (fla Triton uses non-capturable APIs; both fix attempts insufficient) |
| `torch.compile` | `--torch-compile` | `AssertionError` in `torch._dynamo.cudagraph_trees.get_obj` |
| Length-bucketed prefill admit | edit `scheduler.SchedulerConfig` defaults | small length variance starves the decode batch (847 → 447 tok/s regression) |
| Mixed-step (chunked prefill) | `SchedulerConfig.use_mixed_step=True` | 951 → 447 tok/s regression measured |
| Prefix caching | edit `engine.py` to re-instantiate `PrefixCache` | 3-token shift breaks batched prefill |

## If something goes wrong

1. **Engine won't start**: check `/tmp/eval_engine.log`. Most common: OOM (wrong GPU), Helion patch not disabled (unset both env vars), port already in use (run `./scripts/stop.sh`).
2. **Engine starts but requests return 500**: check the log for the traceback. Most common: a Helion patch was accidentally enabled, or `--cuda-graphs` / `--torch-compile` was passed by mistake.
3. **GSM8K accuracy < 87.5%**: this would mean the greedy sampler is broken somewhere. The spot checks (Step 2) should catch this earlier. If they pass and GSM8K still fails, check that `temperature=0.0` is being correctly forwarded through the API to the engine (look at `engine/runtime/sequence.py` SamplingParams).
4. **Throughput much lower than 951**: check that `--no-cuda-graphs --no-torch-compile` are in the launch command. If they are and it's still slow, the engine may have warmed up to a worse state due to teammate GPU contention — restart the engine.

## Contact / context

This engine was built in a hackathon timebox. The 951 tok/s @ c=64 single-GPU
result is durable and has been correctness-verified. Multi-GPU strategies were
attempted heavily in the final hour but did not produce a measured improvement
over single-engine — DP=4 measured at 930 tok/s (worse), TP/EP code shipped but
not launched in time.

The fundamental constraint was the eval's hard cap of c=64: at that
concurrency, parallelism strategies that split requests across multiple GPUs
under-utilize each rank and lose more than they gain. The realistic path to
beating 951 was per-rank speedup (CUDA graphs / torch.compile / Helion
kernels), and each of those hit deeper kernel-level issues than fit the
remaining time budget.
